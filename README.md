Earthquake and Tectonic Plate Visualization

This project uses Leaflet.js and D3.js to visualize earthquake and tectonic plate data on an interactive map. It displays earthquake markers with magnitudes and depths represented by circle sizes and colors, respectively. Tectonic plate boundaries are shown as lines on the map.
